# Coms311Assignment3
Group Repository for ComS 311 Project 3

In this project we implemented methods to find the most important pixels in an image and crop the image accordingly so that only the most important pixels are part of the image. 
This was done with the help of dynammic programming with which we implemented the minCutVC matrix which finds the minimum cost path in the array of pixels and uses that in order to form an importance matrix with only the most important pixeld.
This project also incorporates string alignment thich aligns two given strings with the minimum cost. it compares letters in each word and then assigns cost to them accordingly. 
For example: dictionary and lion would be aligned as: 

dictionary
l$$$ion$$$ with a cost of 26. The cost of adding a $ would be 4 and the cost of two letters being unequal would be 2. There wouold be no cost if the letters are the same. 

Everythng in this project uses Dynammic Programming implementations.
